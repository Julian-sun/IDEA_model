This repository contains a **Python implementation of the Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)** 
to be used in the context of early warning detection of epidemic surges, developed as part 
of the **AESOP Project**.

The original MEM methodology was proposed and widely implemented in **R**. This work provides 
a **fully Python-based implementation**, designed for large-scale, scalable and municipality-level 
surveillance analyses, particularly within the AESOP Project.

---

## Methodological reference

The implementation follows the principles described in:

> Vega T, Lozano JE, Meerhoff T, Snacken R, Mott J, Ortiz de Lejarazu R, Nunes B.
> *Influenza surveillance in Europe: establishing epidemic thresholds by the moving epidemic method.*
> **Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses**, 2013; 7(4): 546–558.

Key adaptations include:

* a Python-native implementation,
* flexible seasonal definitions at the municipality level,
* integration with rolling averages and automated parameter selection,
* scalability for nationwide surveillance systems.

---

## Workflow overview

The MEM pipeline is executed in **three main steps**, each corresponding to an executable script.

## 1. Select seasonal definition and delta (per municipality)

**Script:** `def_sea_peri_MEM_all_cities.py`

This script:

* loads municipal-level surveillance data,
* applies MEM using multiple seasonal definitions (e.g. calendar year or
  influenza-style seasons),
* searches over a range of `delta` values,
* and selects the configuration that satisfies predefined constraints on
  epidemic onset and epidemic growth.

Each municipality is processed independently.

### Input data requirements

The input dataset must contain, at minimum:

* `co_ibge` – municipality code
* `epiyear` – epidemiological year
* `epiweek` – epidemiological week
* `atend_ivas` – weekly ILI/IVAS counts

Additional metadata columns (state, municipality name, rates) may be included.

### Outputs

* `def_sea_MEM_out_<date>.parquet`
  Selected seasonal definition and MEM parameter (`delta`) for each municipality.

* `set_bad_cities_<date>.csv`
  Municipalities for which no valid MEM configuration was found.

---

## 2. Estimate MEM baselines and epidemic thresholds (per municipality)

**Script:** `mem_thresholds_all_cities.py`

This script:

* loads municipal-level weekly surveillance data,
* loads the selected seasonal definition and `delta` from Script 1,
* applies a 4-week moving average to smooth time series,
* dynamically constructs epidemiological seasons (calendar year or shifted
  influenza-style seasons),
* applies MEM independently to each municipality,
* estimates baselines and epidemic thresholds,
* computes low, medium, and high intensity levels.

The seasonal structure used for each municipality exactly matches the one
selected in the previous step.

### Outputs

* `mem_output_<date>.parquet`
  Consolidated MEM results per municipality, including:

  * baseline and post-baseline values,
  * epidemic and post-epidemic thresholds,
  * intensity levels (low, medium, high),
  * seasonal metadata.

---

## 3. Define epidemic surges and generate warning signals
**Script:** `mem_define_surges_all_cities.py`

This script:

* loads MEM thresholds estimated in Script 2,
* applies MEM-based surge definitions to weekly IVAS counts,
* generates:
    * binary epidemic surge indicators (0/1),
    * multi-level surge intensity categories,
* removes isolated one-week signals and enforces temporal consistency,
* applies a fallback statistical definition for municipalities where MEM
  thresholds could not be estimated,
* merges MEM-based and fallback results into a unified dataset.

### Outputs
* `aesop_<date>_with_MEM.parquet`
Final dataset containing weekly MEM-based surges indicators per municipality,
ready for visualization, modeling, and decision-support workflows.

## Notes

* This implementation adapts the original MEM methodology to Python while
  preserving its statistical foundations.
* Seasonal definitions may correspond to the calendar year or to
  municipality-specific epidemic onset weeks.
* All computations are performed independently for each municipality,
  enabling scalable nationwide analyses.
* The code is modular and extensible, and was developed to support real-time
  surveillance workflows within the **AESOP Project**.
